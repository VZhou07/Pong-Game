# Pong-Game
Fun Project I made in grade 10.

TO RUN: Change current directory to Pong-Game and run Pong Game.py. You should also install the pygame version specified in requirements.txt in a venv if the library does not work with your current version.

**Special troll feature only unlocked for those who read the readme file. Press tab during the game to see the special feature... 🥳🥳
